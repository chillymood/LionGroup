Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II 买卖股票的最佳时机 II

Solution 解决方案
Say you have an array prices for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

假设你有一个数组价格，其中第 i 个元素是某只股票当天的价格。

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

设计一个求利润最大化的算法。你可以完成任意数量的交易(例如，多次买入和卖出一股股票)。

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

注意: 你不能同时进行多笔交易(也就是说，你必须在再次买入之前卖出股票)。

Example 1:

例子一:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Example 2:

例子二:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
Example 3:

例子三:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
 

Constraints:

制约因素:

1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10 ^ 4
0 <= prices[i] <= 10 ^ 4
